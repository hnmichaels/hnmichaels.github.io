<h2>About</h2>

<img src="mothersday.jpg" alt=“This is Haley and her fiancé.” style="width:400px;height:300px">

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This website is to function as an online resume for Haley Michaels.</p>
<p>The website will contain the contents of a normal resume, and include links to projects developed by Haley Michaels.</p>
<p>This website functions as an example of the work Haley Michaels is capable of completing individually. This website was coded in the TextEdit application of a MacBook Pro in HTML.</p> 

<h2>Portfolio and Projects</h2>

<p>In order for you to experience what I am capable of doing as a Computer Science student, this section will contain projects I have worked on in school and independently. I have gathered a wide variety of programs from my years at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.</p>

<h3>Projects completed during my education: </h3>
<a href="FarSkiesProject.zip">Far Skies Project: Clicker Game</a>

<h3>Projects completed independently: </h3>

<p>The first independent project I will present you with is this website. I built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My end goal with this project is to have my portfolio available to potential employers or for the viewing of my peers.</p>
