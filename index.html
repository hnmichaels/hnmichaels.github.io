		</blockquote>
		<p>This website functions as a demonstration and collection of my work as a programmer! I have worked as a 
		Student Technical Writer and previously minored in Technical Writing, as well. I find that I have a passion for both science and writing! I believe the idea that one is either passionate
		about science or writing exclusively is not always true. I take joy in programming and solving mathematical equations; and I also
		take great pride in developing well-rounded documentation. I hope that more people decide to pursue ALL of their passions, not
		just one!</p>
		<p>This online portfolio contains: </p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
			<li>A brief About Me</li>
			<li>Snippets of Code</li>
			<li>Complete Coding Projects</li>
			<li>Examples of Technical Editing</li>
			<li>Composed Technical Documents</li>
			<li>My Official Resume</li>

	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>A quote that I believe represents my aspirations in life is from Mae Jemison:</p>
		<blockquote id="MaeJemison">
		"Don't let anyone rob you of your imagination, your creativity, or your curiosity. It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live." --Mae Jemison
		</blockquote>
		<p>As you most likely already know, my name is Haley Powers! I am a wife, 
		student, researcher, and pursuer of knowledge. I always try to push myself, 
		and others, to keep learning beyond the walls of an institution! I am passionate 
		about my field of study and have found joy in my work, both in school and work. 
		I like to start with a description of my passions when I first introduce myself 
		because I feel demographical answers don’t reflect my personality as well, and I 
		believe the first few seconds between people crucially affect people’s perspectives 
		of each other. </p>
		<p>Now, to get to know my background a bit more, let’s dive into the facts! 
		I am currently a Senior at the University of Alabama in Huntsville majoring 
		in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I graduated 
		high school from Northside High School in Tuscaloosa, AL in 2016 and began my 
		college journey at Auburn University. At Auburn I majored in Architecture, but it 
		did not take long for me to figure out that I was not meant for that career. I was 
		not passionate about the type of work I would be doing post-graduation and decide 
		to take a bit of an off year in August of 2017. During that off time, I researched 
		career paths and investigated where my passions lied. I landed in technology since 
		I love to create and inspire change, so I decided on Computer Science as my field! 
		I applied to the University of Alabama in Huntsville and began my new journey in May 
		of 2018. Now, I am ecstatic about my coursework and looking forward to pursuing a 
		career in the field. </p>
		<p>Outside of my education I have created a life full of creativity, love, and 
		stability. In April of 2020 I legally married by wonderful husband, and in August 
		of 2020 we were able to have a beautiful ceremony to celebrate with loved ones. 
		The year 2020 also introduced me to some new, and now some of my most favorite, 
		hobbies! I learned to cook new dishes, create unique art, and learn about new topics 
		outside of technology. I would like to follow this with a quote from a paper I wrote 
		for my Technical Editing course in the spring semester of 2020: </p>
		<blockquote id="MaeJemison">
		“Most of all, I learned that life is full of so much more than work and school. Life is about the relationships you surround yourself with and the things you do to make the world around you a little bit brighter! I hope when this pandemic ends, and the virus is but a memory, that the world remembers the days when the world relaxed for just a minute. I hope they remember to love, sing, dance, paint, bake, and smile, enjoy the ride of life; it’s only for so long!”
		</blockquote>
		<p>I have committed myself to reaching high for my goals and never ceasing in my love 
		of learning. The year 2020 taught me a lot about myself and I am forever thankful that, 
		for just a moment, I got to see that I have not lost myself in the stress of my studies. 
		I grew up not travelling far outside of the south-eastern United States and limited the risks 
		that I took. I plan to continue to step out of my comfort zone and keep chasing dreams as they 
		come! I want to travel to see the history of human existence and experience the diverse cultures 
		of the world, then I want to make a difference in that world. I look forward to working with a team 
		to develop products that inspire change and make the world just a little bit brighter!</p>

	<h3>Coding Projects</h3>
		<p>In order for you to experience what I am capable of doing as a Computer Science student, this section will contain projects I have worked on in school and independently. I have gathered a wide variety of programs from my years at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and individual work completed during my down time. I have provided a brief description of each project that will allow you to select which one you would like to view first!</p>
	<h4>Projects completed during my education: </h4>
		<a href="FarSkiesProject.zip">Far Skies Project: Clicker Game</a>
		<p>1. Far Skies: Alice Bang, Cameron Cooper, Haley Michaels, and Sean Pagani</p>
		<p>This project was created through a collaborative effort by the authors listed above. We developed this game as our term project for our Intro to Object Oriented Programming in Java course at UAH. 
		The project is a space-themed clicker game that includes classic pixel art (authentically designed by the authors) and introduces levels to the timeless format. Our team worked hard to deliver our best work, 
		and we hope to continue to modify the game for possible publication.</p>
	<h4>Projects completed independently: </h4>
		<p>The first independent project I created is this website. I designed this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My end goal with this project is to have my portfolio available to potential 
		employers, or just for my friends to enjoy!</p>

<div id="TechnicalCommunication" class="tabcontent">
	<h3>Technical Communication</h3>
	<p>Technical Communication is a secondary passion I discovered when I took the required EH 301 (Technical Writing) course for my major. I thoroughly enjoyed 
	composing documents, creating templates, and developing stylesheets. I knew I wanted to keep learning about technical communication, so I added a minor in Technical Writing 
	to my educational plan. However, I dropped the minor before graduating from the University of Alabama in Huntsville in order to avoid scheduling conflicts. 
	Regardless, I still have a passion for technical documentation and the affect it has on how a user interacts with a product. Below there are two sections, one for my 
	educational accomplishments and one for a description of my job duties.</p>
		<h4>Educational Accomplishments</h4>
			<a href="OfficialProposal.docx">Proposal</a>
			<p>1. EH 301 Project Proposal</p>
			<p>The first example is a proposal I put together for my term project during my EH 301 (Technical Writing) course at UAH. The proposal outlined my research plan,
			scope, and other elements that were essential to completing my term project.</p>
			<a href="TermProjectDocument.docx">Term Project</a>
			<p>2. EH 301 Final Project</p>
			<p>The second example is the final result of my term project for my technical writing course. The project included detailed sections, forms I created, and reference images. 
			When I was working on this project I worked at the Dunkin Donuts on campus at UAH, and I was passionate about my team being successful. Creating this document 
			lead to me becoming a better team lead and helped me encourage my team to improve daily!</p>
			<a href="ProgressReport1.docx">Progress Report 1</a>
			<p>3. EH 302 Progress Report 1</p>
			<p>The third example is one of the progress reports compiled while I filled the role of team leader for my group in my EH 302 (Technical Editing) course. 
			In this course, our class was divided into groups and each group had a team leader. During the course we worked with another class of engineers on a document 
			that outlined the work they had been doing throughout their semester. The technical editing teams provided our professor with four total progress reports that detailed 
			what we had done during that given period as a team and individually. The above example is the first report I composed for my team!</p>
			<a href="Project4.5.1.docx">Debrief of the Interdisciplinary Experience</a>
			<p>4. EH 302 Debrief of the Interdisciplinary Experience</p>
			<p>At the end of my Technical Editing (EH 302) course, our professor asked us to compose a debrief describing our experience. During the semester, we worked 
			with a group of engineers on our semester project. In my debrief I described my experience with the course and how it helped my grow as an editor!</p> 
		<h4>Technical Writing Position</h4>
			<p>In March of 2020 I was offered a position with UAH as a student technical writer. However, almost right after I was offered the job, the pandemic shutdown occurred 
			and my hiring process was delayed. Thankfully, in May of 2020 I was able to join the IMPACT team at the Earth System Science Center and have remained an employee to 
			date. My job is to create documentation for products, edit and update existing documentation, and use reStructuredText files to develop online documentation through 
			Sphinx to host documentation on github. The reason I am not posting my work with the team is because I am not certain of the legal aspects of my work. However, if you 
			are interested in my work with the team, please feel free to reach out to me and I will get you in touch with my supervisor! I left this position in 
			August of 2020 to begin a new position witht the University of Alabama in Huntsville as a Research Assistant II.</p>
