	<h3>Coding Projects</h3>
		<p>In order for you to experience what I am capable of doing as a Computer Science student, this section will contain projects I have worked on in school and independently. I have gathered a wide variety of programs from my years at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and individual work completed during my down time. I have provided a brief description of each project that will allow you to select which one you would like to view first!</p>
	<h4>Projects completed during my education: </h4>
		<a href="FarSkiesProject.zip">Far Skies Project: Clicker Game</a>
		<p>1. Far Skies: Alice Bang, Cameron Cooper, Haley Michaels, and Sean Pagani</p>
		<p>This project was created through a collaborative effort by the authors listed above. We developed this game as our term project for our Intro to Object Oriented Programming in Java. The project is a space-themed clicker game that includes classic pixel art (authentically designed by the authors) and introduces levels to the timeless format. Our team worked hard to create our best work, and we hope to continue to modify the game for possible publication.</p>
	<h4>Projects completed independently: </h4>
		<p>The first independent project I created is this website. I designed this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My end goal with this project is to have my portfolio available to potential employers, or for the viewing of my peers.</p>
